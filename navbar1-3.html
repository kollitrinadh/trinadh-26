    Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year[2] three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.[4][5] de Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[6] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[7] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[8] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty (16 balls), fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest ODI 150 (62 balls).</p>

    Glenn James Maxwell (born 14 October 1988) is an Australian professional cricketer. He has played for the Australia national cricket team in all formats of the game since 2012, although he is primarily a One Day International and Twenty20 International specialist.[3] Maxwell is an all-rounder who is known for his sometimes unorthodox batting and bowls right arm off-break deliveries. Domestically he played for Victoria and Melbourne Stars.[4] He was part of the Australian squads that won the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2021 T20 World Cup. His ability to make unconventional shots like reverse sweeps and pulls often makes it hard to set fields that cover all of his scoring areas.[5]
